# City-Workout

The project involved developing a web-based personal workout tracking application using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
The application enables users to manage their preferences and track their workouts. 
To deliver an enhanced user experience and ensure accurate tracking of workout activities, the Geolocation API and Google Maps' server-side data rendering were employed to asynchronously detect the user's location. As a result, the application provides users with a seamless and accurate workout tracking experience.

Application built by HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

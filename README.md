# City-Workout

Developed a web application to track personal workout plans. The application uses Geolocation API and
Google Maps’ server-side data rendering to detect the user’s position asynchronously.
This application allows the user to manage their workout whether cycling or running.
User can easily enter their distance(km), duration(min) cadence(step)/elevation gain(meters). 

Application built by HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
